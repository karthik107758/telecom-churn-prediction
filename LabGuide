# 🧪 Lab Guide: Telco Churn Prediction in Microsoft Fabric

## 🔹 Objective
Build an end-to-end churn prediction pipeline using Microsoft Fabric and Power BI.

---

## 🟢 Phase 1: Setup

1. Create Fabric workspace: `Telecom_Churn`
2. Create Lakehouse: `TelcoLakehouse`
3. Upload CSV to Lakehouse Files
4. Use Table Import Wizard to create `TelcoChurn` table

---

## 🧠 Phase 2: ML Modeling

1. Open Notebook and attach to Lakehouse
2. Load data using Spark → Pandas
3. Clean and encode features
4. Train Random Forest model
5. Evaluate using classification report
6. Save predictions to `ChurnPredictions` table

---

## 📊 Phase 3: Reporting

1. Open Power BI → Create Report
2. Connect to Lakehouse → `ChurnPredictions`
3. Build visuals:
   - Churn rate by contract
   - Monthly charges vs churn
   - Tenure vs churn
4. Add slicers and filters
5. Publish to workspace

---

## 📁 Phase 4: GitHub Documentation

1. Create repo: `telecom-churn-prediction`
2. Add folders: `data`, `notebooks`, `docs`, `screenshots`
3. Include:
   - `README.md`
   - `lab_guide.md`
   - Architecture diagram
   - Power BI screenshots
